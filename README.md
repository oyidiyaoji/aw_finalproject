# aw_finalproject

Welcome to my first project!

My name is Oyidiya Oji and I took a Full Time Data Science course at allWomen in Barcelona. As a sum-up I did a final project about Micro Finance Institutions (MFI). The dataset I took it from the World Bank and it's a record of their results between 1999 and 2019. I worked with 3 different datasets:

1.Financial performance of MFIs (in USD). Note the information is available from 1999 until 2020, but there are not many organizations having data from the last 2 years.
2.Companies location (country and region)
3.Social performance of MFIs. Note this data is available from 2007 to 2018. It was in 2007 when they started to register their social policies.

I wanted to study what kind of social policies were stablished on MFIs and how they are spread around the world as well as their influence. In order to learn more I also based my research on annual reports released between 2010 and 2019.

I worked on the following during my final project:

- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning (supervised and unsupervised)
- NLP (PDF scraping and wordclouds)


I hope you enjoy learning about the project as much as I did.

Oyidiya :)
